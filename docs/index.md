## The Basic Idea

Fastrf is a web server that makes it easy to create radio frequency (RF) gain line ups 📡, link budgets 🌎📡🛰️, and simulation models 🧪🧮 to caputre the performance of a RF system.

This project will stand on the shoulders of some giants:
- [https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/)
- [https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/)
- [https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf](https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf)

## Features

- Poetry (virtualenv and deployment to PyPi)
- black (linting/formatter)
- autoflake (removing unused packages)
- isort (dependency organization)
- mypy (static type checking)
- pytest (including test coverage)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted at [fastrf.iancleary.me](https://fastrf.iancleary.me/).

> Thank you to Netlify for builds and hosts the documentation 🙂🚀🎉!

### Netlify and Mkdocs

The `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt` enable Netlify to build the docs.

> They are not for fastrf development. pyproject.toml specifies flit settings

These are required to configure Netlify's deployment and pull request previews for mkdocs

#### Requirements.txt

<https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/#mkdocs>

#### Runtime.txt

Specifies python version for Netlify

<https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#python>

## Installing fastrf

Install the latest release:

```bash
pip install fastrf
```

Or you can clone `fastrf` and get started locally

```bash
# install all dependencies (including dev)
make python-three-six
```

### Dependencies

The `pyproject.toml` file is used by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install dependencies into a virtual environment.

> Poetry Command Line Interface Documnetation:
> <https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/>
